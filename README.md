# GENET

Reinforcement learning resources for the Performance-oriented Congestion Control
project.

## Traces

### Real Traces

Real traces are recorded on Pantheon platform and they can be downloaded from
[Pantheon](https://pantheon.stanford.edu/measurements/node/). There are three
connection types: cellular, ethernet, and wifi. The path to store them is
`${project_root}/data/${connection_type}`

### Syntheic Traces

Generated by `${project_root}/src/simulator/trace.py`

## Configuration files

The configurations are stored at `${project_root}/config/train`

## Training

### udr training

`${project_root}/src/simulator/train_rl.py`

### genet training

`${project_root}/src/simulator/genet_improved.py`

<!-- ## Overview -->
<!--  -->
<!-- This repo contains the gym environment required for training reinforcement -->
<!-- learning models used in the PCC project along with the Python module required to -->
<!-- run RL models in the PCC UDT codebase found at github.com/PCCProject/PCC-Uspace. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Training -->
<!-- To run training only, go to ./src/gym/, install any missing requirements for -->
<!-- stable\_solve.py and run that script. By default, this should replicate the -->
<!-- model presented in A Reinforcement Learning Perspective on Internet Congestion -->
<!-- Control, ICML 2019. -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Testing Models -->
<!--  -->
<!-- To test models in the real world (i.e., sending real packets into the Linux -->
<!-- kernel and out onto a real or emulated network), download and install the PCC -->
<!-- UDT code from github.com/PCCProject/PCC-Uspace. Follow the instructions in that -->
<!-- repo for using congestion control algorithms with Python modules, and see -->
<!-- ./src/gym/online/README.md for additional instructions regarding testing or training models in the real world. -->
